" This script redefines 6 search commands (/,?,n,N,*,#). At each search, it
" shows at which match number you are, and the total number of matches, like
" this: "At nth match out of N". This is printed at the bottom line at every
" n,N,/,?,*,# search command, automatically.
"
" I am posting this plugin because I find it useful.

" :ShowSearchIndex - Checking your match index
" -----------------------------------------------------
" At any time, you can use :ShowSearchIndex to show at which match index you
" are without moving the cursor.
"
" If cursor is exactly on the match, the message is:
"     At Nth match of M
" If cursor is between matches, following messages are displayed:
"     Betwen matches 189-190 of 300
"     Before first match, of 300
"     After last match, of 300

" To disable colors for messages, set g:indexed_search_colors to 0.
"
" Performance
" ------------------------------------------------------
" Plugin bypasses match counting when it would take too much time, i.e. too
" many matches or too large a file.  You can change these limits with
" g:indexed_search_max_lines and g:indexed_search_max_hits.

" Wishlist
" -  using high-precision timer of vim7, count number of millisec
"    to run the counters, and base auto-disabling on time it takes.
"    very complex regexes can be terribly slow even of files like 'man bash'
"    which is mere 5k lines long. Also when there are >10k matches in the file
"    set limit to 200 millisec
" - implement CursorHold bg counting to which too_slow will resort
" - even on large files, we can show "At last match", "After last match"
" - define global vars for all highlights, with defaults
